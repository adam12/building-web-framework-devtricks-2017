# What is a Web Framework?

Curated set of components that operate well together.

Feature-complete out of the box.

Productivity-inducing.

???

- Basis of web framework
  - A lot of decisions removed from your control

---

# Web Framework History

* ColdFusion ~ 1995
* ASP ~ 1998
* Struts ~ 1999
* Drupal ~ 2001
* HTML::Mason ~ 2001
* ASP.NET ~ 2002
* Ruby on Rails ~ 2004
* Django ~ 2005

???

- First recognized web framework was ColdFusion in 1995.

- Drupal is listed here but hugs the boundary of not being a web framework.

- Ruby on Rails changed the game for many.

# When to use a pre-made Framework

* Quick team onboarding
* Easier hiring
* Quicker time to market *sometimes*
* Problems solved for you
* Less experienced team

---

# When to build your own Framework

* Comfortable with web development
* A desire to better understand pieces
* Swappable components
* Control your destiny
* Only the pieces you need, nothing you don't

???

Very much like a choose your own adventure.

Wrong component might cause some grief.

You generally won't die at the end of this adventure.

---

# Picking your components

* Choose small, modular components
* Look at repository to determine "life" of project
  * Lots of open issues? Avoid
  * Maintainer not active on issue tracker? Avoid
  * Not comfortable owning project one day? Avoid
* License matches your project
* Build adapters for components you're not sure of


???

What I want you to consider when choosing your own adventure.

# My Web Framework

???

I've already completed this adventure. Here's my framework for most projects.

---

# Roda

* Core of our framework
* Routing (Controller) Layer
* Ships with many *optional* features


```ruby
require "roda"

class App < Roda
  route do |r|
    r.root do
      "Hello World"
    end
  end
end
```

---

# Sequel

* Database adapter
* Model Layer
* Ships with many *optional* features


```ruby
require "sequel"

DB = Sequel.connect(ENV["DATABASE_URL"])

class Post < Sequel::Model
end

@posts = Post.all
@post = Post.create(title: "The Blogpost Title")
```

---

# Erubi

* Rendering of Markup
* View Layer
* Fast and familiar to most
* Advanced features (capture tags)


```ruby
require "roda"

class App < Roda
  plugin :render, escape: :erubi

  route do |r|
    r.root do
      render(:index)
    end
  end
end
```

---

# Forme

* Rendering of form elements
* Applying of validation properties to inputs (red border for error, etc)


```eruby
<%|= form(@model_object) do |f| %>
  <%== f.input :title %>
  <%== f.button value: "Save" %>
<%| end %>
```
